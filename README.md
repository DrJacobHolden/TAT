# Transcription Assistance Toolkit
Welcome to the readme for the Transcription Assistance Toolkit. This is a program that has been created to aid in the process of creating a speech corpus. Accessibility was a key principle in its design and therefore it should be approachable by both experienced speech researchers and newbies as well. This readme will contain basic instructions on running and building TAT. Reading this, despite the name, is entirely optional and most users may wish to simply start the program and have a play before returning here to learn about the more advanced functionality.

## Running and Building

TAT comes with a pre-built JAR containing all dependencies, assuming Java is installed on your system a user simply needs to run the JAR to start the program.

If you wish to modify the source and run, you may do so using Maven. Simply load the source code as a Maven project into Eclipse or IntelliJ and modify as to your desires.

## Licensing
TAT is an open-source software provided as-is. Continued support is not guaranteed. It is distributed freely under the Apache license.
